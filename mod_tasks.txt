I ask you if it would be possible to make a version of the free skills mod, specifically for termina,
where every skill is unlocked from the start, meaning I never need to kill other contestants for their abilities,
but I still need to unlock the skills with soul stones.
edit: if it can be made for both, it would be even better, but prioritize termina if you can't

Hello, Can I bother you with these? I have downloaded the "Playable Non-Playables" mod and they do not seem to work with your mods.
previously,  before I downloaded the "Playable Non-Playables" mod, your mod works just fine but when I downloaded the mentioned mod, it now doesn't.

For funger 1 is there i way for the mod to give me the items at a slower pace? (other than just setting the amount to 1 as opposed to 99)
Perhaps even say like a 1 time thing?

So if I set items to be given to 1 over 99 I still hit 99 in amount fairly quickly since its on map change.
For example if I got 1 every other map change or perhaps on battle start instead.
Also perhaps a mod for slower  hunger and mind decay rate would be sweet. 
Cut preferably by half.
