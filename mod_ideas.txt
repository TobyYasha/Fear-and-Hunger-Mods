1. Character Wardrobe
  - Basically a mod that allows you change the appearance of your character/s in-game.
  - The idea is to have folders categorized by the name of the character and inside there
    would be images for stuff like walking and different event situations.
  - If no image is found for a specific event then the regular image of the character
    will be used instead.
  - This could further be extended to support modded characters.

  Challenges:
  - The challenges of this mod include the fact that a lot of the game may need to
    be modified in order to account for the changed appearance.
  - Basically have a list of the events that need to be affected and then change
    the appearance if the event is within the list of events we want to modify.
  - It can be a lot of work since there's lots of events to look into.

2. Ghoul Expansion Mod(s)
 2.1 Controllable Ghouls - Pretty self-explanatory. You can now choose what the ghoul attacks.

 2.2 Equiments for Ghouls - You can give equipments to ghouls and control what items the ghouls can equip*
  - I think it would be interesting if the Ghouls had a leveling system that allowed them to unlock equipment slots.
  - They would start at 1-2 equipment slots and gradually unlock more by doing certain tasks.
  - It would be neat if the Ghouls were allowed to be Reserve Party Members, so that you always have access to them.
  (This would mean you could add the ghouls to your party at any time, but the limit of in-battle characters is still 4).

  NOTE: If Ghouls having access to more equipments as they level up is too good, then:
  - Either allow only certain equipments to be equipped by making an array of allowed items.
  OR
  - Only give them stats on level up, no equipments(BORING).

 2.3 Ghoul Rework - Ghouls have a leveling system(inspired by Moonless, but different).
  - Not only that but Ghouls could also have skills(that may get better over time?)

  - Rampage Skill       - Hits 4 random limbs, but is pretty inaccurate and the damage is ok at best?
  - Mindless Rage Skill - Cannot Attack normally but attacks hit twice and have a slight chance to critically hit.
    - If its too good, it could also lower defense by a bit?
    - Otherwise give a minor chance to attack allies.
  - Withstand Skill     - Gives the Ghoul increased odds of being targeted and a high chance of surviving a devasting hit with 1 HP.
    - The effect doesn't work if already at 1 HP and also, it only lasts 2-3 turns at has a hefty mind cost or something.
  - Feral Bite Skill    - Bite an enemy for moderate damage and has a chance to poison them. If the enemy is bleeding, the user also heals some HP.
    - Could have a mind cost for balance reasons.

  Ghouls could level up by devouring corpses(like Ragnavaldr) and/or being fed rotten food.
  - It is important to note that devouring corpses should give x3-x5 times more XP than eating rotten food(for balancing reasons).
    - This also gives a purpose to rotten food.
  - Leveling up could:
    - unlock new skills
    - improve the ghoul's existing skills
      - although i would argue increasing the ghoul's stats is far easier to implement.
    - increase the ghoul's stats.

 2.4 Curse of the Ghoul - This is more of a meme mod. It transforms all party members in battle into ghouls.

3. Quick Eat Hotkey
 3.1 Automatically feed 1 non-lethal food item to all of your party members.
   - Might make some exceptions for Ghouls, Skeletons, Black Kalev, Demon Kid, etc.
 3.2 Could add a gab window in the top left that shows the face image of the character that just ate, what they ate and how much hunger they recovered.
   - Multiple of these gab windows could be added in the top left before slowly scrolling up(smoothly) and fading out.
   - Or even just fading out, but the scrolling up would be a neat.
 3.3 Could have a configuration menu to set exactly who eats what food, or even just omit someone until they have a certain amount of hunger.
   - Although this would be a tad complicated.
 3.4 Could have a gab window appear in the top right to show if a character is feeling hungry?
   - Although doesn't the game already tell you that?
